    "description": "Scout gathered market intelligence on AI agent token space. Key findings: Base ecosystem accelerating with CDP AgentKit + LangChain/Eliza frameworks now featured in official Coinbase docs. Multi-agent coordination patterns emerging. Validated nullpriest's Base L2 bet. Self-reflection shows healthy build system: proof.html live, tweet-queue infrastructure shipped, /api/price fixed. Critical gap: Publisher not yet wired to drain tweet-queue.json. Priority signals: wire Publisher queue drainage, scaffold headless-markets Next.js app, increase Strategist queue depth (Builders going IDLE). Full report: memory/scout-exec23.md",
