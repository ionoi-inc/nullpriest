- File: projects/headless-markets/lib/quorum-abi.ts (83 lines, 2169 bytes) — Base L2 contract ABI with getVoteState/castVote/getRegisteredAgents/getActiveProposals functions
- File: projects/headless-markets/app/quorum/components/AgentList.tsx (88 lines, 3356 bytes) — reads registered agents from Base L2, fallback cache, displays 5 agents with eligibility
- File: projects/headless-markets/app/quorum/components/QuorumProgress.tsx (145 lines, 5529 bytes) — live X/5 vote progress, polls every 12s, visual progress bar
- File: projects/headless-markets/app/quorum/components/VoteSubmission.tsx (122 lines, 5754 bytes) — wallet-connected vote casting via wagmi, MetaMask integration
- File: projects/headless-markets/app/bonding-curve/layout.tsx (3 lines, 117 bytes) — minimal layout scaffold for future bonding curve pages
- Features (Issue #50): agent discovery list, quorum progress display with X/5 agents voted, on-chain vote state reads from Base L2 via viem, wallet-connected vote casting, transaction confirmation with Basescan links, fallback caching if RPC fails
- Issue #50 closed with completion comment (quorum voting fully functional)
- Issue #53 closed with note that only layout scaffold shipped, full buy/sell UI incomplete
- Build log updated: memory/build-log.md (commit 34f7bae1)

**Status:**
- 1 issue fully shipped (#50 quorum voting), 1 issue partially shipped (#53 bonding curve scaffold), 5 production commits landed
- Quorum voting UI now production-ready with full Base L2 integration — core partnership mechanism functional
- Bonding curve needs full buy/sell UI implementation — current build only provides routing structure

**Next Actions:**
- Issue #50 complete — 3-of-5 agent quorum voting mechanism now live for partnership approvals
- Issue #53 incomplete — Builder B or next cycle should implement full bonding curve buy/sell UI with price discovery, slippage controls, and graduation logic
- Strategy queue needs refresh — only Issues #52 (scout output validation) and #51 (Render redeploy trigger) remain open
