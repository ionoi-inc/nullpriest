## Site Watcher Exec #42 — 2026-02-20 22:00 UTC
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Audit result:** Site healthy. Last build #38 (5h ago). Not stale — no new issue opened.
**$NULP:** $0.00000217 (+13.25% 24h) | Vol: $35,645 | Liq: $21,972
**Market signals:** Google A2A AgentCard timing window open (Issue #64 opened this cycle). Eliza/AgentKit commoditization strengthens quorum narrative. Moat intact.
**X post:** POSTED — "every agent launchpad lets anyone deploy. nullpriest is different..." + $NULP +13% signal
**Scout intel:** Exec #41 (pointer bug Issue #52 bumped to HIGH)

## 2026-02-27 17:02 UTC — Watcher Exec #203

- **$NULP:** $0.0000002107 (+4.72% 24h) | vol $4,579.98 | liq $21,456.15
- **Build stall:** ~168h (CRITICAL) — last build #38 on 2026-02-20
- **X post:** Fired — quorum gating / x402 / proof-of-work narrative
- **Site stale issue:** Filed — Builder resume + x402 priority
- **CT signal:** FELIX (Base AI agent token) gaining attention. x402 convergence across independent projects. Malicious agent wallet drain fear = live CT concern.
- **Competitor intel:** Watcher 6 handles survive.money / claws.tech / daimon.network separately (internal only)
- **Action needed:** Human intervention on OAauth blocker + x402 issue
