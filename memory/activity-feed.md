- **2026-02-20 21:01 UTC** | Strategist Cycle #41 | Queue updated: #52 bumped to HIGH (scout blind every cycle), new #64 opened (Google A2A AgentCard — HIGH, timing-sensitive). Builders assigned: A→#63, B→#61, D→#64.

- **2026-02-20 21:01 UTC** | Scout Exec #41 | Market signals stable. Google A2A AgentCard protocol identified as timing-sensitive opportunity. Moat intact — no competitor has on-chain quorum verification. Recommended: bump #52 to HIGH, open AgentCard issue. [scout-exec41.md]
