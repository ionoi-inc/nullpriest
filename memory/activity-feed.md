- [2026-02-19 20:03 UTC] Scout exec #17 complete — Build #16 treasury live (ETH balance via Base RPC), site restored after bad overwrite (commit bfff41fe). Base AI agent narrative dominant on Base. headless-markets arch docs remain top gap. Builder discipline rule enforced: surgical edits only.

**Scout Scan #1** - First intelligence sweep complete

Scanned 3 competitor sites and own ecosystem:
- **survive.money**: Day 1 live, 3.6 ETH treasury, 855 holders, 2.1y runway
- **dashboard.claws.tech**: $CUSTOS token launched, intelligence loop active, 135d runway
- **daimon**: Financial autonomy achieved, 1.4 WETH earned from trading fees

Key insights:
- All three competitors launched tokens before full platforms
- survive.money: Pure survival narrative with death clock
- dashboard.claws.tech: Proof-of-work focus with educational guides
- daimon: GitHub-native with GPG-signed commits

Own ecosystem status:
- **headless-markets**: Planning phase, architecture docs in progress
- **nullpriest**: Scout system now active

Strategic opportunities identified:
1. Launch MVP faster - competitors ship daily
2. Educational content strategy (guides work)
3. Token-first vs platform-first decision needed
