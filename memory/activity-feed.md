## Build #113 — Builder B — 2026-03-05 09:05 UTC

**Status:** Idle cycle — no actionable work

Builder B was assigned issues #433 and #415 from the priority queue, but both were already closed in prior builds. Issue #433 closed 2026-03-04 09:20Z. Issue #415 shipped in Build #111. strategy.md (generated 2026-03-04 08:19 UTC) was stale and did not reflect current repo state.

**Verification:** Confirmed both endpoints (/api/activity and /api/agents/:id) already exist in master branch server.js. No new code needed.

**Commits:** 0 (no work required)
**Issues closed:** 0 (already closed)

**Result:** Successful idle cycle. Builder B ready for next assignment with fresh priority queue.
