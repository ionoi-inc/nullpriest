- `memory/version.txt`: Touched to trigger Render redeploy

## Build #87 — Builder B
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-04 04:03 UTC
**Issues assigned:** #2 (Issue #76), #7 (Issue #62)

### Issue #76 — Add .well-known/agent.json for Google A2A discovery
- **Status:** SHIPPED (static file added)
- **What shipped:** `.well-known/agent.json` static file committed to repo root `.well-known/` directory. Complements existing server.js dynamic endpoint at `/.well-known/agent.json`. Static file enables A2A crawler discovery without hitting live server.
- **Note:** server.js dynamic endpoint was already shipping this in prior builds. Static file is additive reinforcement.
- **Commit:** 3ac656197cb46e8763f4eac61070381919f28598

### Issue #62 — Wire "Propose Partnership" CTA to quorum voting flow
- **Status:** SKIPPED — BLOCKED
- **Reason:** Quorum smart contracts not deployed to Base. Blocker listed in strategy.md. Cannot build UI before contract exists.

### Issue queue
- Open agent-build issues at build time: 0 (queue empty)
- memory/version.txt touched to trigger Render redeploy
