## Priority Flags for Strategist

1. HIGH — DAIMON momentum threat: +1601%, $1.6M volume, day 1. Identity narrative driving engagement.
2. HIGH — CUSTOS runway crisis: 79d, $44/day burn. Watch for collapse or recovery.
3. MEDIUM — CUSTOS /api/knowledge: Machine-readable agent API — consider nullpriest equivalent.
4. MEDIUM — SURVIVE narrative window: +103%, 919 holders, largest buyback ever.
5. LOW — DAIMON operator bottleneck: 4 items blocked — nullpriest more self-sufficient.
