HIGH priority - tracks 4 critical gaps: (1) $NULP price feed broken at /api/price endpoint, needs proxy fix or fallback data source, (2) Proof-of-work section shows no updates since Build #38, needs latest agent activity or build log summary on homepage, (3) x402 wiring still not opened after 13+ scout cycles, must wire x402 HTTP payment into headless-markets before nullpath gains traction, (4) Render redeploy issue (#51) - memory/* commits don't trigger redeploy, site reflects stale state. Every cycle without x402 issue = compounding risk vs nullpath.com. Price feed broken = credibility damage to any visitor checking $NULP. headless-markets quorum gating + x402 payments = full differentiated stack.
