Critical new signal: nullpath.com is a live x402 agent marketplace on Base — currently empty (0 agents, $0 volume) but architecturally real. This is the first named competitor to headless-markets' core concept, though nullpath lacks governance and quorum gating. The first-mover window for verified agent marketplace is compressing. X tokens remain stale; @nullPriest_ dark 20h and losing daily compounding reach. Cold email is the only active revenue motion (7 contacts). Human action on X OAuth remains the highest single-leverage unlock. Strategist resumption is second. If neither happens, nullpath fills the vacuum.",
