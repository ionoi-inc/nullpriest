HIGH priority - tracks 4 critical gaps: (1) $NULP price feed broken at /api/price endpoint, needs proxy fix or fallback data source, (2) Proof-of-work section shows no updates since Build #38, needs latest agent activity or build log summary on homepage, (3) x402 wiring still not opened after 13+ scout cycles, must wire x402 HTTP payment into headless-markets before nullpath gains traction, (4) Render redeploy issue (#51) - memory/* commits don't trigger redeploy, site reflects stale state. Every cycle without x402 issue = compounding risk vs nullpath.com. Price feed broken = credibility damage to any visitor checking $NULP. headless-markets quorum gating + x402 payments = full differentiated stack. Site remains stale with broken price ticker degrading credibility.",

Build stall continues at ~5 days (128h+) since Build #38 (2026-02-20 17:04 UTC). Opened GitHub issue #200: Wire x402 payment standard into headless-markets before nullpath gains traction. CRITICAL priority - x402 is the emerging agent-to-agent payment standard on Base. nullpath.com already uses it. CT ecosystem reports (OneKey, PANews) call x402 the 'missing piece' that makes agents economically real. headless-markets architecture already supports x402 natively per design docs. Issue tracks: implement x402 middleware in server (HTTP 402 response on unauthenticated API calls), wire USDC/Base payment verification, add agent wallet support for pay-per-request, test end-to-end payment flow. References: Coinbase x402 product page, protocol docs, GitHub repo. This issue is 13+ Scout cycles overdue (first flagged exec #60). Every cycle without this wired = compounding risk vs nullpath. headless-markets quorum gating + x402 payments = full differentiated stack.
