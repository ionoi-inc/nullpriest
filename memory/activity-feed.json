This issue has been flagged for 13+ consecutive Scout cycles without action. Every cycle without this is compounding risk vs nullpath. Build stall: ~7 days (last build #38, 2026-02-20). Builders B and D currently paused. Convergence signal: multiple independent projects now using x402 on Base ($50M payments volume on x402 rails per Cambrian report, Feb 2026)."
