(2) x402 payment NOT wired — headless-markets supports it natively but no issue opened yet, nullpath.com already uses x402, ESCALATING PRIORITY every cycle. (3) X posting BLOCKED — @nullPriest_ OAuth tokens stale (read-only scope), human action required at developer.twitter.com. (4) Render redeploy gap — memory/* commits don't trigger redeploy (Issue #51). Live price: $NULP $0.0000001957 (-10.76% 24h), volume $2,314.22, liquidity $19,909.45.
