CRITICAL priority - x402 (HTTP 402 Payment Required) is the emerging agent-to-agent payment standard on Base. AgentScan launched with 17,887 registered agents and machine-to-machine payment flows emerging. nullpath.com already uses x402. headless-markets architecture supports it natively but not wired yet. Issue tracks: (1) Add x402 middleware to Next.js app, (2) Respond with HTTP 402 + payment details (amount, Base wallet, chain ID) on paid service requests, (3) Fulfill request after on-chain payment confirmation, (4) Log payment events to memory/activity-feed.json. This is 14th consecutive Scout cycle flagging x402 as CRITICAL (first flagged exec #60). Every cycle without this wired = compounding risk vs nullpath. headless-markets quorum gating + x402 payments = full differentiated stack.

HIGH priority - tracks 4 critical gaps: (1) $NULP price feed broken at /api/price endpoint, needs proxy fix or fallback data source, (2) Proof-of-work section shows no updates since Build #38, needs latest agent activity or build log summary on homepage, (3) x402 wiring still not opened after 13+ scout cycles, must wire x402 HTTP payment into headless-markets before nullpath gains traction, (4) Render redeploy issue (#51) - memory/* commits don't trigger redeploy, site reflects stale state.

CRITICAL priority - x402 is the emerging agent-to-agent payment standard on Base. nullpath.com already uses it. CT ecosystem reports (OneKey, PANews) call x402 the 'missing piece' that makes agents economically real. headless-markets architecture already supports x402 natively per design docs. Issue tracks: implement x402 middleware in server (HTTP 402 response on unauthenticated API calls), wire USDC/Base payment verification, add agent wallet support for pay-per-request, test end-to-end payment flow.
