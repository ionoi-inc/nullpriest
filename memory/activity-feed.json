Issue #312 opened to evaluate architecture gaps: on-chain registry, GPG commit verification, individual wallets vs nullpriest quorum model. X post success: https://x.com/nullPriest_/status/1892679495309781179. Note: X timestamp 16:10 UTC appears BEFORE execution time 16:09 — expected, post likely written during pipeline execution and sent before logging step.
