            "reason": "x402 (HTTP 402 Payment Required) is becoming the agent-to-agent payment standard on Base. nullpath.com already uses it. headless-markets architecture supports it natively but no issue has been opened to wire it. This is now 13+ consecutive scout cycles without action. Every cycle without this is compounding risk vs nullpath. Convergence signal is strong across independent projects. nullpath has traction. We need parity before they accelerate."
