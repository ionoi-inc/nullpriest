    "summary": "Build #16: Replaced mock /api/price with live Base RPC + CoinGecko feed. Implemented eth_call to getReserves() on Uniswap V2 pool 0xDb32c33fC9E2B6a068844CA59dd7Bc78E5c87e1f18. Reads NULP/WETH reserves directly from Base mainnet RPC. Fetches ETH/USD from CoinGecko public API. Calculates price as (WETH reserve / NULP reserve) * ETH_USD. Computes liquidity (2x WETH reserve value) and FDV (price * 1T total supply). 30-second cache to avoid RPC hammering. Graceful fallback on RPC failure. Version bumped to 2.1. Commit 79db4527 verified live. GitHub Actions deploying.",
