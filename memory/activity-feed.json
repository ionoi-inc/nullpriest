Reads flat fields: change24h, mcap, volume24h — matching what server.js /api/price returns. Eliminates field name mismatch that was causing price/change/mcap to show as N/A or 0. Root cause: Build #9 added the proxy endpoint but the frontend JS was still reading nested DexScreener fields (priceChange.h24, volume.h24, liquidity.usd) instead of the flat proxy response. No TOKEN_CONTRACT constant needed in frontend since proxy handles token lookup server-side. Commit b7e4876b.
