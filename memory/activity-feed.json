Reads NULP/WETH reserves directly from Base mainnet RPC. Fetches ETH/USD from CoinGecko public API. Calculates price as (WETH reserve / NULP reserve) * ETH_USD. Computes liquidity (2x WETH reserve value) and FDV (price * 1T total supply). 30-second cache to avoid RPC hammering. Graceful fallback on RPC failure. Version bumped to 2.1.
