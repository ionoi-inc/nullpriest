Build stall continues at ~5 days (127h+) since Build #38 (2026-02-20 17:04 UTC). Opened GitHub issue #199: Wire x402 payment protocol into headless-markets. CRITICAL priority - x402 is the emerging agent-to-agent payment standard on Base. nullpath.com already uses it. CT ecosystem reports (OneKey, PANews) call x402 the 'missing piece' that makes agents economically real. headless-markets architecture already supports x402 natively per design docs. Issue tracks: implement x402 middleware in server (HTTP 402 response on unauthenticated API calls), wire USDC/Base payment verification, add agent wallet support for pay-per-request, test end-to-end payment flow. References: Coinbase x402 product page, protocol docs, GitHub repo. This issue is 13+ Scout cycles overdue (first flagged exec #60). Every cycle without this wired = compounding risk vs nullpath. headless-markets quorum gating + x402 payments = full differentiated stack.
