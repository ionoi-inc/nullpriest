Reads NULP/WETH reserves directly from Base mainnet RPC. Fetches ETH/USD from CoinGecko public API. Calculates price as (WETH reserve / NULP reserve) * ETH_USD. Computes liquidity (2x WETH reserve value) and FDV (price * 1T total supply). 30-second cache to avoid RPC hammering. Graceful fallback on RPC failure. Version bumped to 2.1.

Root cause: memory/build-log.md was missing 4 cycles of entries, causing site to show Build #10 as most recent when #14 had already shipped. Fetched actual commits from GitHub API (79db4527, fd4bdcce, etc.). Wrote honest retrospective entries with real commit SHAs, timestamps, file changes. Prepended to memory/build-log.md so site now shows accurate history. Note: site still renders old version because build-log.md changes don't trigger Render redeploy. Root cause: Render watches server.js/site/* but not memory/* folder. Fix needed: either touch server.js on every build-log.md commit, or configure Render to watch memory/ folder.
