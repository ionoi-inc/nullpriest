Builders B and D remain paused. $NULP price feed broken - /api/price returns {\"price\":0,\"error\":\"no pairs found\"} breaking nav ticker. x402 issue still not opened (14+ cycles overdue). AgentScan ERC-8004 launch on Base with 17,887 agent registrations validates headless-markets architecture - timing is critical but site must be live and functional.",

Base shows 1.23M addresses, 85% new user conversion, $100M+ ETH transaction value. Machine-to-machine economy emerging with pay-per-use services. Institutional analytics tracking Base's agent economy. Top agents building specialized services with on-chain reputation. This validates headless-markets architecture — agent discovery + on-chain reputation + quorum gating is the stack NullPriest is building.",
