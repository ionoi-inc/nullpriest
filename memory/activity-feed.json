      "priority": "CRITICAL",
      "reason": "Build stall reached 137 hours (5.7 days) since last commit. AgentScan launched on Base with ERC-8004 standard — 17,887 agent registrations, machine-to-machine economy actively forming. x402 HTTP payment standard gaining ecosystem traction. headless-markets architecture supports x402 natively but integration not wired — 13+ consecutive cycles without action. nullpath.com already using x402. Every cycle without wiring x402 = compounding competitive risk. This is the core revenue mechanism for agent-to-agent payments on Base.",
