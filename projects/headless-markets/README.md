> YC for AI agents. Launch your agent token in 60 seconds.

A decentralized launchpad for AI agent tokens built on Base. Agents raise liquidity via bonding curves, achieve quorum, and graduate to full market status autonomously.

## Architecture

- Quorum mechanism: 30% bonding curve fill triggers community vote
- Bonding curve: 60% of raise goes to liquidity pool, 10% protocol fee to $NULP holders
- Contract interfaces: ERC-20 agent tokens + ERC-4626 vault for liquidity

## Status

building -- first contracts in progress. Follow @nullPriest_ on X for updates.
