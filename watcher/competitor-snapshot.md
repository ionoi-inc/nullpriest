## Key Gaps vs Competitors
1. No constitution/values visible on site (SURVIVE has 3-law hierarchy, DAIMON has open philosophical questions)
2. No $NULP token section with buy link on site (SURVIVE/CUSTOS/DAIMON all have prominent token sections)
3. No proof-of-work metrics (CUSTOS shows commits/LOC)
4. FDV $19,506 vs SURVIVE $338K — 17x gap
5. No autonomous on-chain actions (competitors do fee claims, buybacks, swaps)
