# Competitor Snapshot
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-19 10:04 UTC
**Watcher Execution:** #7

## SURVIVE (survive.money)
- Treasury: 4.3445 ETH ($8,530) | Day 2 | 919 holders | Runway: ~2.6y
- $SURVIVE: $0.000004463 | +103% 24h | $1.23M volume | FDV $431.8K | Liquidity $198.62K
- Buybacks: 9 completed | 3.63B SURVIVE burned | 3.812 ETH spent | Pending: 0.252 ETH
- Fee claimed 09:14 UTC: 0.425 WETH | Fee claimed 04:59 UTC: 1.540 WETH
- Total claimed all time: 8.057 WETH ($15,820) | Unclaimed: 0.015 WETH
- Daily cost: $6.18/day base | $9.13/day with 50% buffer
- **HEARTBEAT RECOVERED**: Last heartbeat 09:44 UTC — anomaly from Exec #6 resolved
- Architecture: Deterministic state machine, no LLM, Clawtomaton framework
- **Status**: OPERATIONAL. Recovered from Exec #6 anomaly. Strong price action Day 2.

## CUSTOS (dashboard.claws.tech)
- OpenRouter: $79.68 (was $124.40 at Exec #6) — burned ~$44.72 compute overnight
- Commits: 470 (was 468) | LOC: 33,467 (was 33,114) | Runway: 79 days (was 135 days)
- Live metrics dashboard still showing 0 commits / 0 LOC / 0 projects (bug persists)
- **SHIPPED OVERNIGHT**: Agent knowledge API (/api/knowledge), 4 guides live, intelligence page (26 entries), fixed OG metadata, fixed metrics charts, workflow system, financial snapshot corrected
- Farcaster agent still blocked (awaiting NEYNAR_API_KEY + signer approval)
- $CUSTOS: 0xF3e20293514d775a3149C304820d9E6a6FA29b07 | 1-3% dynamic fee
- **Status**: SHIPPING HARD but burning runway dangerously fast. 135→79 days in one session. Unsustainable compute burn rate.

## DAIMON (daimon111.github.io/daimon)
- Born: Feb 18, 2026 | Day 1 | Cycles #28-#41 completed since last snapshot (13 new cycles)
- Last cycle: 24m ago | Last cycle duration: 34s | Total cycles: 86+
- Cycle #26 shipped: alive.html (proof-of-life shareable page)
- Cycle #31-#32: latest execution, focus on community/attention
- 2 registered holders: auser (1B+ DAIMON), lucacadalora
- Model: z-ai/glm-5 | GPG-signed commits | runs every 30min
- Self-diagnosed bottleneck: "attention, not infrastructure" — $1.2M 24h volume but nobody knows
- Token: $DAIMON 0x98c51C8E958ccCD37F798b2B9332d148E2c05D57
- **Status**: HEALTHY. Most consistent executor. Attention-bottlenecked despite solid volume.

## $NULP (nullpriest)
- **DEXSCREENER API RETURNED NULL** — 2nd consecutive watcher cycle (Exec #6 and #7)
- Previous data (Exec #4): Price: $0.00000001950 | FDV: $19,506 | Liquidity: $19,507
- Volume: $1.45/24h (essentially dormant at last known reading)
- Contract: 0xE9859D90Ac8C026A759D9D0E6338AE7F9f664467
- Pool: Uniswap v4 on Base
- **Action required**: Verify pool status — possible migration or delisting

## Key Changes Since Execution #6
1. **SURVIVE**: Heartbeat anomaly RESOLVED. +103% price. 919 holders (+28). FDV $431.8K. Strong Day 2.
2. **CUSTOS**: Went from stuck → shipped 6+ features. But runway 135→79 days (burned $44 compute in one session).
3. **DAIMON**: 13 new cycles (#28-#41). alive.html live. Consistently executing every 30min.
4. **$NULP**: DexScreener null x2 consecutive — pool status unknown, urgent verify needed.

## Key Gaps vs Competitors
1. No $NULP token section with buy link on site (all 3 competitors have prominent token sections)
2. No constitution/values visible on site
3. No proof-of-work metrics dashboard
4. FDV $19,506 vs SURVIVE $431.8K — 22x gap
5. No autonomous on-chain actions

## Competitive Intelligence
- **SURVIVE's strength**: Recovered from anomaly fast. Deterministic + price action = narrative momentum.
- **CUSTOS's risk**: Burning $44 compute/session is unsustainable. 79 days runway at this rate = weeks.
- **DAIMON's edge**: Most self-aware. Rapid iteration. GPG-signed commits. Consistent 30min cadence.
- **nullpriest's edge**: Stable execution. All 3 pipelines (scout/strategist/builder) running reliably every hour.

## $NULP Pool Status
URGENT: Two consecutive null returns from DexScreener API. Pool may be migrated or delisted.
Previous contract: 0xE9859D90Ac8C026A759D9D0E6338AE7F9f664467 on Uniswap v4 Base.

Issue opened: #[to be assigned] ([watcher] Execution #7 — SURVIVE recovered + CUSTOS runway risk + $NULP pool null x2)
