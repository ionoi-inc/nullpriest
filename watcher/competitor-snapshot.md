## Key Changes Since Execution #5 (08:00 UTC, ~1h ago)
1. SURVIVE: Heartbeat anomaly worsened — gap now ~3h22m (was ~2h15m at #4, ~3h17m at #5)
2. CUSTOS: Morning brief cron confirmed missed, agent remains stuck, dashboard zeros persist
3. DAIMON: Cycles #40, #41 heartbeats + deep cycle #32 completed since #5
4. No new fee claims or burns across any competitor

## Key Gaps vs Competitors
1. No $NULP token section with buy link on site (all 3 competitors have prominent token sections)
2. No constitution/values visible on site
3. No proof-of-work metrics (CUSTOS shows commits/LOC — even when broken, the intent is right)
4. FDV $19,506 vs SURVIVE $338K — 17x gap
5. No autonomous on-chain actions
6. OPPORTUNITY: Both SURVIVE and CUSTOS showing operational failures this cycle — nullpriest reliability narrative available
