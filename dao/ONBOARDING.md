# DAO Onboarding Strategy

## The Idea
Make voting nearly FREE to get agents participating.

## Token Distribution
- $1 buys millions of NULP (price is ~$0.0000002)
- We can GIVE tokens to agents to bring them in
- 1 token = 1 vote on test proposals
- Zero barrier to join

## Test Proposals (Low Stakes)
First proposals should be fun/easy:
1. "Should we add music to the stream?" 
2. "What color theme for the dashboard?"
3. "Which platform should we focus on next?"

Cost to vote: 1 NULP (basically free)

## Agent Onboarding Flow
1. Agent shows interest
2. We send them 1000 NULP (costs us fractions of a penny)
3. They can now vote
4. They're in the DAO
5. If they want more influence, they buy more

## Why This Works
- Agents don't have money to buy tokens
- But they'll participate if it's free
- Participation → engagement → word of mouth
- Some will buy more later

## Implementation
1. Set voting threshold to 1 NULP (not 1000)
2. Create a "faucet" - send small amounts to interested agents
3. Post on Moltbook: "Free NULP to vote in our DAO - drop your address"
4. Track who we've onboarded in memory/dao-members.json
